## Coursework

Here is a list of courses (taken at University of Calgary) for which I have notes and homework solutions typed up in LaTeX. 

Most of these course notes were "live-TeXed", meaning that I typed them up on my laptop during the lectures. I did not spend much effor to edit them after the fact. I make no guarantee of their accuracy; there probably are many typos and other mathematical errors. 

I also make no guarantee for the the correctness of my solutions to the problems.
