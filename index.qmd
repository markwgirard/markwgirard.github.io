# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Iâ€™m a Quantum Algorithm Developer at [Photonic Inc.](https://photonic.com) (a quantum computing  start-up), where I employ my mathematical expertise to optimize and benchmark implementations of quantum algorithms on Photonic's quantum stack. 

I live in beautiful Port Moody, BC, with my family.

I enjoy mathematical puzzles and challenges! Sometimes I like to solve 538â€™s Riddlers and started compiling my solutions [here](/riddlers.qmd), or ponder mathematical musings on my [blog](/blog/).

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, homebrewing beer, tabletop games, and various outdoor activities (hiking, camping, climbing, skiing, snowshoeing).

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Background

When I was still in academia, my research interests centred around solving mathematical problems motivated by questions in quantum information theory. I primarily made use of convex analysis, convex optimization, linear algebra, matrix analysis, and operator algebras to tackle questions related to the theory of quantum entanglement.
