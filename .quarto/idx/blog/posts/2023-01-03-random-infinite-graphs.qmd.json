Define a sequence of finite subsets $A_1,A_2,\\dots$ of $\\mathbb{N}$ and functions $f_1,f_2,\\dots$, where\n\n$$\nf_n:A_n\\to\\mathbb{N}\n$$\n\nfor each $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ recursively as follows.\n\nDefine $A_1=\\lbrace 1\\rbrace$ and $f_1(1)=1$. Note that $f_1$ is injective and trivially satisfies the relations $\\lbrace  1\\rbrace \\subseteq A_1$ and $\\lbrace 1\\rbrace \\subseteq f_1(A_1)$.\n\nGiven a number $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, suppose we have defined $A_n$ and $f_n$ such that $f_n$ is injective and satisfies the properties that\n\n$$\n\\lbrace 1,2,\\dots n\\rbrace \\subseteq A_n \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\lbrace 1,2,\\dots n\\rbrace \\subseteq f_n(A_n).\n$$\n\nConsider two cases concerning whether $n+1\\in f_n(A_n)$.\n- Suppose that $n+1\\in f_n(A_n)$. In this case, let $a\\in A_n$ such that $f_n(a)=n+1$.\n- Conversely, if $n+1\\notin f_n(A_n)$, by universality of $G$, there exists a choice of vertex $a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus A_n$ such that, for all $s\\in A_n$, the equivalence\n\n$$\n\\lbrace  a,s\\rbrace \\in \\operatorname{Edges}(G) \\iff \\lbrace n+1,f_n(s)\\rbrace \\in\\operatorname{Edges}(H)\n$$\n\n  holds.\n\nSimilarly, consider the following cases:\n- If $n+1\\in A_n$, let $b=f_n(n+1)$.\n- If $a=n+1$, where $a$ is the number chosen above, also let $b=n+1$.\n- Otherwise, analogous to the step above, by universality of $H$ there exists a choice of vertex $b\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus f_n(A_n)$ such that, for all $s\\in A_n$, the equivalence\n\n$$\n\\lbrace n+1,s\\rbrace \\in \\operatorname{Edges}(G) \\iff \\lbrace b,f_n(s)\\rbrace \\in\\operatorname{Edges}(H)\n$$\n\n   holds.\n\nRegardless of which of the cases above were used, define\n\n$$\nA_{n+1} = A_n\\cup\\lbrace n+1, a\\rbrace\n$$\n\nand $f_{n+1}:A_{n+1}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ as $f_{n+1}(s)= f_n(s)$ for every $s\\in A_n\\setminus\\lbrace n+1,a\\rbrace $, and\n\n$$\nf_{n+1}(n+1) = b \\quad\\text{and}\\quad f_{n+1}(a) = n+1.\n$$\n\nIt is evident that $f_{n+1}$ is injective, and that $\\lbrace 1,\\dots,n+1\\rbrace \\subseteq A_{n+1}\\cap f_{n+1}(A_{n+1})$.\n\nWith the subsets $A_1,A_2,\\dots$ and functions $f_1,f_2,\\dots$ defined this way, note that we have the chain of inclusions\n\n$$\nA_1\\subseteq A_2\\subseteq \\cdots.\n$$\n\nMoreover, for every $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, it holds that $f_{n+1}\\|_{A_n} = f_n$ and for pair of distinct numbers $a,b\\in A_n$ we have the equivalence\n\n$$\n\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace \\in \\operatorname{Edges}(G) \\iff \\lbrace f_n(a),f_n(b)\\rbrace \\in \\operatorname{Edges}(H).\n$$\n\nWe may now define the desired graph isomorphism $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ as\n\n$$\nf(n) = f_n(n)\n$$\n\nfor every $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n$\\square$\n\n\n## Random infinite graphs are almost always the same\n\nWe now get to the main point of this post: random infinite graphs.\n\nWe can randomly construct a graph on a set of vertices as follows. Given a set of vertices $V$, for each pair of distinct vertices in $V$, a biased coin is flipped with a probability of $p$ of landing on heads. If the coin lands on heads, an edge is created between those two vertices. This process is repeated for all pairs of distinct vertices in $V$, and the events of whether an edge is created between two vertices are independent of one another. Essentially, the graph is constructed by randomly deciding, with a certain probability, whether or not to add an edge between each pair of distinct vertices.\n\nThis process induces a probability measure on the set $\\operatorname{Graph}(V)$ of all graphs having vertex set $V$, which is\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Graph}(V) = \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\binom{V}{2}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ denotes the power set of a set $S$. For each pair of distinct elements $a,b\\in V$, define\n\n$$\nA_{\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace } = \\big\\lbrace G\\in \\operatorname{Graph}(V)\\,:\\, \\lbrace a,b\\rbrace \\in\\operatorname{Edges}(G)\\big\\rbrace\n$$\n\nto be the event that the randomly generated graph contains the edge connecting $a$ and $b$ such that\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\big(\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace \\in\\operatorname{Edges}(G)\\big) = \\operatorname{Pr}(A_{\\lbrace a,b\\rbrace }) = p,\n$$\n\nand these events are all independent of each other.\n\nWe now turn our attention to infinite graphs. It turns out that random graphs constructed this way are almost always all isomorphic to each other. This is because a graph constructed this way is almost always universal!\n\n>**Theorem.** Let $G$ be a random graph with $\\operatorname{Vertices}(G)=\\mathbb{N}$ constructed as above. The ranom graph $G$ is universal with probability $1$.\n\n*Proof.* We prove that the set of graphs that are not universal is a set of measure zero. Given disjoint finite sets $S,T\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}$ and a number $a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus (S\\cup T)$, let $A(S,T,a)$ denote the event that in the graph $G$, the vertex $a$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S$ and not adjacent to every vertex in $T$. That is,\n\n$$\nA(S,T,a) = \\Bigg(\\bigcup_{s\\in S} A_{\\lbrace a,t\\rbrace }\\Bigg)\\cup\\Bigg(\\bigcup_{t\\in T} (A_{\\lbrace a,t\\rbrace })^c\\Bigg).\n$$\n\nNote that the probability of this event is given by\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\big(A(S,T,a)\\big) = p^{|S|}(1-p)^{|T|}.\n$$\n\nGiven finite disjoint subsets $S,T\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}$ that are not both nonempty, note that the events $A(S,T,a)$ and $A(S,T,b)$ are independent from one another for each choice of $a,b\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus (S\\cup T)$ and thus\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{Pr}\\Bigg(\\bigcap_{a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus(S\\cup T)}A(S,T,a)^c\\Bigg)\n&= \\prod_{a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus(S\\cup T)}\\left(1-p^{|S|}(1-p)^{|T|}\\right)\\\\\n&=\\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\left(1-p^{|S|}(1-p)^{|T|}\\right)^k\\\\\n & =0,\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nas $0 \\lt p^{\\vert S\\vert}(1-p)^{\\vert T\\vert}\\lt 1 $. Now, the event that the random graph is *not* universal is\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\bigcup_{S\\in\\binom{\\mathbb{N}}{k}}\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}\\bigcup_{T\\in\\binom{\\mathbb{N}\\setminus S}{k}}\\Bigg(\\bigcap_{a\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus(S\\cup T)}A(S,T,a)^c\\Bigg),\n$$\n\nwhich is a countable union of a measure-zero sets, and thus also has zero measure.\n$\\square$\n\nWe conclude that there is a graph $H$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ such that a randomly generated graph $G$ is almost always isomorphic to $H$.\n\n>**Corollary.** With probability one, random graphs on $\\mathbb{N}$ are all isomorphic to one another.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\nI picked up a book at a used book store recently: *[Probabilistic Methods in Combinitorics](https://www.amazon.ca/Probabilistic-Methods-Combinatorics-Paul-Erdos/dp/0122409604)* (1974) by Paul Erdős and Joel Spencer.
