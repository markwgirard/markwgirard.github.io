I really like puzzles! The *Riddler* (now *The Fiddler*) gives me a chance to explore something new each week — sometimes analytically, sometimes computationally, sometimes artistically.

> _“Fiddler on the Proof” offers weekly mathematical puzzles as well as other discussion about the puzzling community. The Fiddler is a spiritual successor to The Riddler column at FiveThirtyEight, which ran for eight years under the stewardship of Zach Wissner-Gross and Ollie Roeder._
