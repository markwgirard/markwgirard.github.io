## Solutions to homework assignments

The solutions provided by the course coordinator were not very clear or written very well. To help you improve your proof-writing techniques, I wrote up a collection of nicely written solutions to the homework assignments in a proper way.

You can find the solutions (along with good proof-writing tips) [here](sols.pdf).

## Final Exam Practice

**Note**: These files are intended to provide you help to do some practice to prepare for the final exam for this course, but do not necessarily reflect the specific problems that will appear on your exam.
### Practice problems
I made a collection of practice problems to help you prepare. \[[Here](MATH137_final_practice_probs.pdf) are the problems and [here](MATH137_final_practice_probs_solutions.pdf) are the solutions.\]

### Exams from previous terms
Here are some final exams from previous years with solutions.
 - Fall 2018 \[[Exam](137 Final Exam F18.pdf) and [solutions](MATH 137 F18 FE Sols.pdf)\]
 - Fall 2019 \[[Exam](F19 Practice Final.pdf) and [solutions](MATH 137 Practice Final Exam Solutions.pdf)\]
