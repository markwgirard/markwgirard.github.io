Here's my solution to this week's [Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-cover-the-baking-sheet-with-cookies/). (See more of [my Riddler solutions here](/riddlers).)

## The Problem
>Suppose you have a unit square (i.e., with side length 1). If you also have four identical circles that can overlap, they would need to have a radius of $\sqrt{2}/4$ to completely cover the square, as shown below:

## The Solution
Interestingly this problem appears to have been previously solved (more on that in a minute). But first, my solution:
### My solution
I guessed that the best solution would have a bit of reflectional symmetry. With the help of some amazing geometric drawing software ([Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/)), I was able to come up with a solution with $r\approx 0.326$ with the diagram below:

Note that $0.326<.3535 \approx\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}$ so this solution is definitely an improvement over simply covering the square with 4 squares.

I wanted to come up with a more exact value. By expressing the coordinates of the centres of the five circles in this geometric picture as

$$
\left(-\frac{1}{4}, a\right),\, \left(\frac{1}{4}, a\right), \, \left(-d, -b\right), \, \left(d, -b\right),\,\text{and}\, \left(0, -c\right),
$$

and doing a little bit of work, we can set up a system of equations that the values $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $r$ must satisfy (where $e=\frac{1}{4}$):

$$
\begin{align}
r^2&=\left(\frac{1}{2}-a\right)^2+\frac{1}{16.}\\
r^2&=\left(\frac{1}{2}-b\right)^2+\left(\frac{1}{2}-d\right)^2\\
r^2&=\left(\frac{1}{2}-c\right)^2+\left(2d-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\\
b&=\frac{1}{2}-a\\
r&=2a+c-\frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
$$

With the help of Mathematica, I was able to determine that the only solution to this (with $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, and $r$ all positive) is given by

$$
\begin{align}
a&=-\frac{23808 r^5}{1159}+\frac{2208 r^4}{1159}+\frac{1819 r^3}{1159}+\frac{259 r^2}{244}-\frac{13959 r}{18544}+\frac{31371}{74176}\\
b&=\frac{1}{2}-a\\
c&=2 b+r-\frac{1}{2}\\
d&=\frac{10368 r^5}{1159}+\frac{3824 r^4}{1159}-\frac{9959 r^3}{2318}-\frac{1603 r^2}{488}+\frac{15747 r}{37088}+\frac{95157}{148352}
\end{align}
$$

where $r\approx0.32616$ is the smallest real root of the polynomial equation

$$
425 - 672 x + 352 x^2 - 10240 x^3 + 256 x^4 + 8192 x^5 + 65536 x^6 = 0.
$$

[Edit (18-09-2022): Note that a previous version of the post had an incorrect solution here.]

### Previous work

After a bit of Googling, I was able to stumble upon a few papers that had investigated this and similar problems. By far the best one was [Covering a square with up to 30 equal circles.](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.30.3894&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Nurmela and Östergård (2000). In that work, the authors developed a clever optimization algorithm to determine the smallest radius of circle such that $n$ circles of that size can be used to cover the unit square for $n$ up to 30. Here are the figures for $n=5$ and $n=6$.

![Minimal radius coverings with 5 and 6 disks.](/blog/images/5-and-6-disk-covers.png)

The authors determined the optimal radii for $5$ and $6$ circles to be $r_5=0.32616058400398728086$ and $r_6=0.29872706223691915876$ respectively.
