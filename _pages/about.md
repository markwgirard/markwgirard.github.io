## About me

I earned a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Calgary (2017), where I researched applications of convex analysis to quantum information theory (specifically entanglement theory) under the supervision of [Gilad Gour](https://people.ucalgary.ca/~gour/). Afterward I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) at the University of Waterloo (2017-2020) under the supervision of [John Watrous](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/).

I enjoy mathematical challenges!

Outside of mathematics, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, homebrewing beer, tabletop games, and various outdoor activities (hiking, camping, climbing, skiing, snowshoeing).


### Research

My research interests lie with solving mathematical problems motivated by questions in quantum information theory. I primarily make use of convex analysis, convex optimization, linear algebra, matrix analysis, and operator algebras to tackle questions related to the theory of quantum entanglement.

See a list of my publications [here](publications) and more details of my research [here](research).



## Miscellaneous

 - **[Teaching](teaching)** I've taught numerous courses during my time as an academic.

 - **[Lecture notes and problem solutions](coursework)** TeX'ed up lecture notes and solutions to problem sets of the courses that I took during my graduate studies. You can see the list of courses [here](coursework).

 - **[Riddlers](riddlers)** I have recently gotten into solving 538's [Riddlers](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/) and started compiling my solutions [here](riddlers).
