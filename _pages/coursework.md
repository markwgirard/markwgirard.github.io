Here is a list of courses (taken at University of Calgary) for which I have notes and homework solutions typed up in LaTeX.

Most of these course notes were "live-TeXed", meaning that I typed them up on my laptop during the lectures. I make no guarantee of their accuracy; there probably are many typos and other mathematical errors.

I also make no guarantee on the correctness of my solutions to the problems.
