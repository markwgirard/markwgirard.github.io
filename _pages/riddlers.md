I really like puzzles! The puzzles from the Riddler give me a chance to explore something new each week.

Here is a description of The Riddler from the [FiveThirtyEight website](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/the-riddler/):
>Welcome to The Riddler. Every week, I offer up problems related to the things we hold dear around here: math, logic, and probability.

This is a collection of all of my solutions to the weekly puzzles from FiveThirtyEight's The Riddler series.
