Before transitioning to industry, I spent many years immersed in the academic world of mathematics and physics â€” studying, researching, and teaching in both Canada and abroad.  
This page gathers some of the materials from that part of my life â€” a kind of archive for the mathematically curious.

## Curriculum Vitae

My academic journey included study and research across several institutions:

- **B.Sc. in Mathematics, Physics, and German** â€” Trinity University (San Antonio, Texas), 2006â€“2010  
- **Diplom in Physics** â€” University of Freiburg, Germany, 2010â€“2012  
  *Thesis: Optimal Control of Many-Body Entanglement with Measures Optimized on the Fly*
- **Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics** â€” University of Calgary, 2012â€“2017  
  *Thesis: Convex Analysis for Quantum Information Theory*  
  Adviser: Gilad Gour
- **Postdoctoral Fellow** â€” Institute for Quantum Computing, University of Waterloo, 2017â€“2020  
- **Sessional Instructor** â€” Faculty of Mathematics, University of Waterloo, 2018â€“2020  
  *(Also taught one course at the University of Calgary in 2016)*
