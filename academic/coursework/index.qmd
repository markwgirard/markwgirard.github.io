This page archives some of my graduate coursework from the University of Calgary.

Most of these course notes were “live-TeXed,” meaning I typed them up on my laptop during lectures. I make no guarantee of their accuracy — there are likely typos, gaps, or mathematical errors. I also make no guarantee on the correctness of my solutions to the assigned problems.

That said, others have found them useful over the years, so I’m sharing them here publicly in the spirit of open learning.
